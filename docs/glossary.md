## Roles & Personas

#### _Roles_
---
<table border="0">
<col>
<col>
<tr>
<td width="20%"><b>Chain Member</b></td>
<td>
Entities that do not participate in the validation process of a blockchain network, but help to maintain the integrity of a network. Unlike Chain transactors, chain members maintain a local copy of the ledger.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="20%"><b>Chain Transactor</b></td>
<td>
Entities that have permission to create transactions and query network data.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="20%"><b>Chain Validator</b></td>
<td>
Entities that own a stake of a chain network. Each chain validator has a voice in deciding whether a transaction is valid, therefore chain validators can interrogate all transactions sent to their chain.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="20%"><b>Chain Auditor</b></td>
<td>
Entities with the permission to interrogate transactions.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### _Participants_
