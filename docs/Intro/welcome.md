# Welcome to Hyperledger fabric

The Linux Foundation Hyperledger Project(1) is the result of collaboration between project members(2) 
who share the common goal of designing a business-ready, open-source standard for blockchain networks. 
Extensive research, planning and implementation by this community has led to the Linux Foundation adopting 
Hyperledger fabric as its open source standard for blockchain network architecture.

The Hyperledger fabric blockchain standard is a base architecture, with built-in functionality, security 
and platform independence for blockchain networks. The open standard facilitates adoption by any public or 
private organization or enterprise, and in turn by their constituent members.

## Audience

The audience for this Hyperledger fabric documentation includes members of any public or private group, 
organization or enterprise who are interested in joining the Linux Foundation Hyperledger Project and 
adopting its open standard for their business networks. The organizational roles that this audience fulfills 
are diverse, and include business executives and decision-makers, system architects, network designers, 
application developers, security administrators, auditors and regulators.

Any potential end user of a blockchain business network would also benefit from this documentation, 
including professionals at securities and commodities exchanges, manufacturing plants, distribution centers, 
leasing agencies, business service providers and government agencies.

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisites to employ Hyperledger fabric for blockchain networks are an interest in, and the 
resources to support, a distributed business network that processes transactions with significant decreases 
in cost, increases in speed and enhancements in security, compared to traditional networks. Though not required, 
most adopters of Hyperledger fabric will already be using one or more active business networks; integration of 
these existing networks with Hyperledger fabric is a fully-supported business service.

All sizes of business networks are supported by Hyperledger fabric, from a single node to networks containing 
hundreds of nodes. Typical hardware and software networking components, and resources to develop applications 
and write chaincode, are basic requirements.
