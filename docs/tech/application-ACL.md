# Hyperledger Fabric - Application Access Control Lists

## Overview

We consider the following entities: 

1. *HelloWorld*: is a chaincode that contains a single function called *hello*;
2. *Alice*: is the *HelloWorld* deployer;
3. *Bob*: is the *HelloWorld*'s functions invoker.

Alice wants to ensure that only Bob can invoke the function *hello*.

## Fabric Support

To allow Alice to specify her own access control lists and Bob to gain access, the fabric layer gives access to following capabilities:

1. Alice and Bob can sign and verify any message with specific transaction certificates or enrollment certificate they own;
2. The fabric allows to *name* each transaction by means of a unique *binding* to be used to bind application data
to the underlying transaction transporting it;
3. Extended transaction format.

The fabric layer exposes the following interfaces and functions to allow the application layer to define its own ACLS.
 
### Certificate Handler 

The following interface allows to sign and verify any message using signing key-pair underlying the associated certificate.
The certificate can be a TCert or an ECert.

```
// CertificateHandler exposes methods to deal with an ECert/TCert
type CertificateHandler interface {

    // GetCertificate returns the certificate's DER
    GetCertificate() []byte
    
    // Sign signs msg using the signing key corresponding to the certificate
    Sign(msg []byte) ([]byte, error)
    
    // Verify verifies msg using the verifying key corresponding to the certificate
    Verify(signature []byte, msg []byte) error
    
    // GetTransactionHandler returns a new transaction handler relative to this certificate
    GetTransactionHandler() (TransactionHandler, error)
}
``` 
 

### Transaction Handler

The following interface allows to create transactions and give access to the underlying *binding* that can be leveraged to link
application data to the underlying transaction.


```
// TransactionHandler represents a single transaction that can be named by the output of the GetBinding method.
// This transaction is linked to a single Certificate (TCert or ECert).
type TransactionHandler interface {
 
    // GetCertificateHandler returns the certificate handler relative to the certificate mapped to this transaction
    GetCertificateHandler() (CertificateHandler, error)
    
    // GetBinding returns a binding to the underlying transaction
    GetBinding() ([]byte, error)
    
    // NewChaincodeDeployTransaction is used to deploy chaincode
    NewChaincodeDeployTransaction(chaincodeDeploymentSpec *obc.ChaincodeDeploymentSpec, uuid string) (*obc.Transaction, error)
    
    // NewChaincodeExecute is used to execute chaincode's functions
    NewChaincodeExecute(chaincodeInvocation *obc.ChaincodeInvocationSpec, uuid string) (*obc.Transaction, error)
    
    // NewChaincodeQuery is used to query chaincode's functions
    NewChaincodeQuery(chaincodeInvocation *obc.ChaincodeInvocationSpec, uuid string) (*obc.Transaction, error)
}
```
 
### Client 

The following interface offers a mean to get instances of the previous interfaces.
 
```
type Client interface {

    ...

    // GetEnrollmentCertHandler returns a CertificateHandler whose certificate is the enrollment certificate
    GetEnrollmentCertificateHandler() (CertificateHandler, error)
    
    // GetTCertHandlerNext returns a CertificateHandler whose certificate is the next available TCert
    GetTCertificateHandlerNext() (CertificateHandler, error)
    
    // GetTCertHandlerFromDER returns a CertificateHandler whose certificate is the one passed
    GetTCertificateHandlerFromDER(der []byte) (CertificateHandler, error)
    
}
```
 
### Transaction Format

To support application-level ACLs, the fabric's transaction and chaincode specification format have an additional field to store application-specific metadata.
The content of this field is decided by the application. The fabric layer treats it as an unstructured stream of bytes.    


```

message ChaincodeSpec {

    ...

    ConfidentialityLevel confidentialityLevel;
    bytes metadata;

    ...
}


message Transaction {
    ...

    bytes payload;
    bytes metadata;
    
    ...    
}
```

Another way to achieve this is to have the payload containing the metadata itself.  

### Validators

To assist chaincode execution, the validators provide the chaincode additional information, like the metadata and the binding.  
 
## Application-level access control
 
### Deploy Transaction
 
Alice has full control on the deployment transaction's metadata. 
In particular, the metadata can be used to store a list of ACLs (one per function), or a list of roles. 
To define each of these lists/roles, Alice can use any TCerts/ECerts of the users who have been assigned 
that privilege or role. The latter is done offline. 

Now, Alice requires that to invoke the *hello* function, a certain message *M* has to be authenticated by an authorized invoker (Bob, in our case). 
We distinguish the following two cases:

1. *M* is one of the chaincode's function arguments;
2. *M* is the invocation message itself, i.e., function-name, arguments.
 
### Execute Transaction
  
To invoke *hello*, Bob needs to sign *M* using the TCert/ECert Alice has used to name him in the deployment transaction's metadata.
Let's call this certificate CertBob. At this point Bob does the following:   

1. Bob gets a CertificateHandler for CertBob, *cHandlerBob*;
2. Bob gets a new TransactionHandler to issue the execute transaction, *txHandler* relative to his next available TCert or his ECert; 
3. Bob gets *txHandler*'s *binding* by invoking *txHandler.getBinding()*;
4. Bob signs *'M || txBinding'* by invoking *cHandlerBob.Sign('M || txBinding')*, let *signature* be the output of the signing function;
5. Bob issues a new execute transaction by invoking, *txHandler.NewChaincodeExecute(...)*. Now, *signature* can be included
  in the transaction as one of the argument to be passed to the function or as transaction metadata.

### Chaincode Execution 
 
The validators, who receive the execute transaction issued by Bob, will provide to *hello* the following information:

1. The *binding* of the execute transaction;
2. The *metadata* of the execute transaction;
3. The *metadata* of the deploy transaction.

Then, *hello* is responsible for checking that *signature* is indeed a valid signature issued by Bob.
