## Getting started

Welcome to the Linux Foundation Hyperledger Project documentation README. This page contains:
- Getting started doc links
- Quickstart doc links
- Table of Contents links to the complete library

If you are new to the project, you can begin by reviewing the following documents:
- [Whitepaper WG](https://github.com/hyperledger/hyperledger/wiki/Whitepaper-WG)
- [Requirements WG](https://github.com/hyperledger/hyperledger/wiki/Requirements-WG)
- [Glossary](glossary.md): to understand the terminology that we use throughout the website and project.

When you are ready to start building applications or to otherwise contribute to the project, we strongly recommend that you read our [protocol specification](protocol-spec.md) for the technical details. Procedurally, we use the agile methodology with a weekly sprint, organized by [issues](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues), so take a look to familiarize yourself with the current work.

## Quickstart documentation
In addition to the <b>Getting started</b> documentation, the following quickstart topics are available:
- [Fabric FAQs](FAQ)
- [Canonical use cases](biz/usecases.md)
- [Development environment set-up](dev-setup/devenv.md)
- [Chaincode development environment](API/SandboxSetup.md)
- [APIs](API/CoreAPI.md)
- [Network setup](dev-setup/devnet-setup.md)
