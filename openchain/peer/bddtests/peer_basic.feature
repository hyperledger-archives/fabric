#  @chaincodeImagesUpToDate use this if all scenarios chaincode images are up to date, and do NOT require building.  BE SURE!!!

Feature: lanching 3 peers
    As an openchain developer
    I want to be able to launch a 3 peers

	Scenario: chaincode example 02 single peer
	    Given we compose "docker-compose-1.yml"
	    And I wait "1" seconds
	    When requesting "/chain" from "vp0"

	    Given we compose "<ComposeFile>"
	    And I wait "2" seconds
	    And I register with CA supplying username "binhn" and secret "7avZQLwcUe9q" on peers:
             | vp0  |

		     | vp1  |  test_user1 | jGlNl6ImkuDo |
		     | vp2  |  test_user2 | zMflqOKezFiA |

	    When I deploy chaincode "github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer/openchain/example/chaincode/chaincode_example02" with ctor "init" to "vp0"
		     | arg1 |  arg2 | arg3 | arg4 |
		     |  a   |  100  |  b   |  200 |
	    Then I should have received a chaincode name
	    Then I wait up to "<WaitTime>" seconds for transaction to be committed to peers:
            | vp0  | vp1 | vp2 | vp3 |

        When I query chaincode "example2" function name "query" with value "a" on peers:
            | vp0  | vp1 | vp2 | vp3 |
	    Then I should get a JSON response from peers with "OK" = "100"
            | vp0  | vp1 | vp2 | vp3 |

        When I invoke chaincode "example2" function name "invoke" on "vp0"
			|arg1|arg2|arg3|
			| a  | b  | 20 |
	    Then I should have received a transactionID
	    Then I wait up to "10" seconds for transaction to be committed to peers:
            | vp0  | vp1 | vp2 | vp3 |

        When I query chaincode "example2" function name "query" with value "a" on peers:
