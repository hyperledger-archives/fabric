/*
This is a system chaincode used to update the validity period on the ledger. It needs to be deployed at genesis time to avoid the need of
a TCert during deployment and It will be invoked by a system component (probably the TCA) who is the source of the validity period value.

This component will increment the validity period locally and dispatch an invocation transaction for this chaincode passing the new validity
period as a parameter.

This chaincode is responsible for the verification of the caller's identity, for that we can use an enrolment certificate id or some other
type of verification. For this to work this id (or certificate, public key, etc) needs to be accessible from the chaincode (probably embedded into
the chaincode).

This is the flow for this to work:

1) Obtain some identity id (enrolment certificate id, certificate, public key, etc).
2) Include the information obtained in 1 into this chaincode.
3) Deploy the chaincode
4) Include the chaincode id into the system component that is going to invoke it (possibly the TCA) so it can dispatch an invoke transaction.
