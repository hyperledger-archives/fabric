Usage: fabricLogger ?... parms ...? [... peers ...]

Convert a HyperLedger fabric blockchain into a file that logs all of the
transactions that are found in the blockchain. By default, the entire current
blockchain is converted to a log on standard output and the job
terminates. Each line of the report is a single character followed by a single
piece of information:

b <n>    : Block number <n>
d <ccid> : A chaincode deployment. The <ccid> is the chaincode ID.
i <uuid> : A chaincode invocation. The <uuid> is the transaction UUID.

Note that the block number is printed _after_ all of the block transactions,
to validate to a 'following' client that all transactions of a block have been
seen.

By default, the peer network is defined by the $BUSYWORK_HOME/network file.
However, if one or more peers are provided on the command line, those peers
will be used instead, and the -port option specifies the default REST API port
to use if an explicit peer does not include an explicit port.

To spread the load, if there are multiple peers this script goes to the peers
in round-robin order to try for the next block, even when requests fail in
-follow mode. NOTE: If you are running NOOPS consensus, *do not* specify more
than 1 explict peer, because the blockchains on NOOPS networks are not
guaranteed to be consistent. Note that this issue is handled automatically by
default, as the $BUSYWORK_HOME/network file includes the consensus mode and
only the first peer will be polled in NOOPS networks.

Options:

-h | -help | --help

    Print this usage information and exit normally.

-follow | -noFollow : -noFollow

    By default the job terminates as soon as the last block is processed, that
    is, as soon as a peer does not have the next block. Select -follow to keep
    following forever. In -follow mode the output file is flushed after each
    block is processed.

-followPoll <duration> : 1s

    In -follow mode, once the end of the current blockchain is reached
    fabricLogger will keep polling (alternate peers) at this frequency. If this
    is specified as 0 then fabricLogger will aggressively poll the set of peers
    as fast as possible.

-file <file> : *Standard Output*

    Use -file to specify a log file other than standard output.

-delete | -noDelete : -noDelete

    If logging to a file, the -delete option causes the file to be deleted at
    the exit of the program. This may be useful when other processes are
    following this file.

-retry : 0

    If greater than 0, retry failing HTTP transactions at most this many
    times.

-timestamp | -noTimestamp : -noTimestamp

    This is a debugging flag. If -timestamp is selected then error logging
    from this script will be timestamped.

-force | -noForce : -noForce

    This is a debugging flag. If set, simply log an error if blocks are found
    with invalid JSON, no transactions or other errors and move on. By default
    these types of blocks are considered fatal errors.

-killOnError <pids> : N/A

    If this logger aborts due to an error it sends a SIGINT to every PID in
    this list of PIDS. This flag is used to make drivers terminate more
    quickly if the logger fails..

-port <port> : 5000

    The default REST API port.
