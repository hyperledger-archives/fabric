general:

    # Operational mode: currently only batch ( this value is case-insensitive)
    mode: batch

    # Maximum number of validators/replicas we expect in the network
    # Keep the "N" in quotes, or it will be interpreted as "false".
    "N": 4

    # Number of byzantine nodes we will tolerate
    f: 1

    # Checkpoint period is the maximum number of pbft requests that must be
    # re-processed in a view change. A smaller checkpoint period will decrease
    # the amount of time required to recover from an error, but will decrease
    # overall throughput in normal case operation.
    K: 10

    # Affects the receive log size which is K * logmultiplier
    # The primary will only send sequence numbers which fall within K * logmultiplier/2 of
    # its high watermark, so this cannot be set to less than 2
    # For high volume/high latency environments, a higher log size may increase throughput
    logmultiplier: 4

    # How many requests should the primary send per pre-prepare when in "batch" mode
    batchsize: 500

    # Whether the replica should act as a byzantine one; useful for debugging on testnets
    byzantine: false

    # After how many checkpoint periods the primary gets cycled automatically.  Set to 0 to disable.
    viewchangeperiod: 0

    # Timeouts
    timeout:

        # Send a pre-prepare if there are pending requests, batchsize isn't reached yet,
        # and this much time has elapsed since the current batch was formed
        batch: 1s

        # How long may a request take between reception and execution, must be greater than the batch timeout
        request: 2s

        # How long may a view change take
        viewchange: 2s

        # How long to wait for a view change quorum before resending (the same) view change
        resendviewchange: 2s

        # Interval to send "keep-alive" null requests.  Set to 0 to disable. If enabled, must be greater than request timeout
        nullrequest: 0s

executor:

    # The queue size for execution requests, ordering proceeds and queues execution
    # requests.  This value should always exceed the pbft log size
    queuesize: 30
