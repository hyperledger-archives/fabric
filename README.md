## Overview
Fabric is a project in Incubation that was proposed by Tamas Blummer (DAH) and Christopher Ferris (IBM) (see [Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XECRVN9hXGrjAjysrnuNSdggzAKYm6XESR6KmABwhkE)).

Information on what Incubation entails can be found in the [Hyperledger Project Lifecycle document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1asqGu-6xlldY4uwmnkgJs3uhqUDa_wCdv9-cGUEEIOY).

This project contains a core blockchain fabric code, development environment scripts and documents for developers to contribute fabric code or work on their own applications.

## Building the fabric core <a name="build"></a>
Assuming you have followed the [development environment getting started instructions](docs/dev-setup/devenv.md)

To access your VM, run
```
vagrant ssh
```

From within the VM, you can build, run, and test your environment.

#### 1. Go build
```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric
go build -o peer
```

#### 2. Run

To see what commands are available, simply execute the following command:

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric
    ./peer

You should see some output similar to below (**NOTE**: The root command below is hardcoded in the [main.go](./main.go). Current build will actually create a *peer* executable file).

```
    Usage:
      peer [command]

    Available Commands:
      peer        Run peer.
      status      Status of the peer.
      stop        Stops the peer.
      chaincode   Compiles the specified chaincode.
      help        Help about any command

    Flags:
      -h, --help[=false]: help for peer


    Use "peer [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

The **peer** command will run peer process. You can then use the other commands to interact with this peer process. For example, status will show the peer status.

#### 3. Test
New code must be accompanied by test cases both in unit and Behave tests.

#### 3.1 Unit Tests
To run all unit tests, in one window, run `./peer peer`. In a second window

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric
    go test -timeout=20m $(go list github.com/hyperledger/fabric/... | grep -v /vendor/ | grep -v /examples/)

Note that the first time the tests are run, they can take some time due to the need to download a docker image that is about 1GB in size. This is why the timeout flag is added to the above command.

To run a specific test use the `-run RE` flag where RE is a regular expression that matches the test name. To run tests with verbose output use the `-v` flag. For example, to run TestGetFoo function, change to the directory containing the `foo_test.go` and enter:

    go test -test.v -run=TestGetFoo

#### 3.2 Behave Tests
[Behave](http://pythonhosted.org/behave/) tests will setup networks of peers with different security and consensus configurations and verify that transactions run properly. To run these tests

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bddtests
behave
```
Some of the Behave tests run inside Docker containers. If a test fails and you want to have the logs from the Docker containers, run the tests with this option
```
behave -D logs=Y
```

Note, you must run the unit tests first to build the necessary Peer and Member Services docker images. These images can also be individually built using the commands
```
go test github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/container -run=BuildImage_Peer
go test github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/container -run=BuildImage_Obcca
```

## Building outside of Vagrant <a name="vagrant"></a>
This is not recommended, however some users may wish to build outside of Vagrant if they use an editor with built in Go tooling. The instructions are

1. Follow all steps required to setup and run a Vagrant image
- Make you you have [Go 1.6](https://golang.org/) or later installed
- Set the maximum number of open files to 10000 or greater for your OS
- Install [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/INSTALL.md) version 4.1 and it's dependencies:
```
apt-get install -y libsnappy-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb.git
cd rocksdb
git checkout tags/v4.1
PORTABLE=1 make shared_lib
INSTALL_PATH=/usr/local make install-shared
```
- Run the following commands:
```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric
CGO_CFLAGS=" " CGO_LDFLAGS="-lrocksdb -lstdc++ -lm -lz -lbz2 -lsnappy" go install
```
- Make sure that the Docker daemon initialization includes the options
```
-H tcp://0.0.0.0:4243 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock
```
- Be aware that the Docker bridge (the `OPENCHAIN_VM_ENDPOINT`) may not come
up at the IP address currently assumed by the test environment
(`172.17.0.1`). Use `ifconfig` or `ip addr` to find the docker bridge.


## Code contributions <a name="contrib"></a>
We are using the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) process to manage code contributions.

Note the following GitHub Flow highlights:

- Anything in the master branch is deployable
- To work on something new, create a descriptively-named branch off of your fork ([more detail on fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/))
- Commit to that branch locally, and regularly push your work to the same branch on the server
- When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging,
open a pull request (make sure you have first successfully built and tested with the [Unit and Behave Tests](https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-peer))
- After your pull request has been reviewed and signed off, a committer can merge it into the master branch.

We use the same approach&mdash;the [Developer's Certificate of Origin (DCO)](docs/biz/DCO1.1.txt)&mdash;that the Linux&reg; Kernel [community](http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin) uses to manage code contributions.
We simply ask that when submitting a pull request, the developer must include a sign-off statement in the pull request description.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@hisdomain.com>
```

## Communication <a name="communication"></a>
We use [Slack for communication](https://hyperledger.slack.com) and Google Hangouts&trade; for screen sharing between developers. Register with these tools to get connected.

## Coding Golang <a name="coding"></a>
- We require a file [header](docs/dev-setup/headers.txt) in all source code files. Simply copy and paste the header when you create a new file.
- We code in Go&trade; and strictly follow the [best practices](http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
and will not accept any deviations. You must run the following tools against your Go code and fix all errors and warnings:
	- [golint](https://github.com/golang/lint)
	- [go vet](https://golang.org/cmd/vet/)

## Writing Chaincode <a name="chaincode"></a>
Since chaincode is written in Go language, you can set up the environment to accommodate the rapid edit-compile-run of your chaincode. Follow the instructions on the [Sandbox Setup](docs/API/SandboxSetup.md) page, which allows you to run your chaincode off the blockchain.

## Setting Up a Network <a name="devnet"></a>

To set up an development network of several validating peers, follow the instructions on the [Devnet Setup](docs/dev-setup/devnet-setup.md) page. This network leverage Docker to manage multiple instances of validating peer on the same machine, allowing you to quickly test your chaincode.


## Working with CLI, REST, and Node.js <a name="cli"></a>

When you are ready to start interacting with the peer node through the available APIs and packages, follow the instructions on the [API Documentation](docs/API/CoreAPI.md) page.

## Configuration <a name="config"></a>

Configuration utilizes the [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) and [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) libraries.

There is an **core.yaml** file that contains the configuration for the peer process. Many of the configuration settings can be overridden at the command line by setting ENV variables that match the configuration setting, but by prefixing the tree with *'CORE_'*. For example, logging level manipulation through the environment is shown below:

    CORE_PEER_LOGGING_LEVEL=CRITICAL ./peer

## Logging <a name="logging"></a>

Logging utilizes the [go-logging](https://github.com/op/go-logging) library.  

The available log levels in order of increasing verbosity are: *CRITICAL | ERROR | WARNING | NOTICE | INFO | DEBUG*

See [specific logging control](docs/dev-setup/logging-control.md) when running peer.

## Generating grpc code <a name="grpc"></a>

If you modify any .proto files, run the following command to generate new .pb.go files.

```
devenv/compile_protos.sh
```

## Adding or updating a Go packages <a name="vendoring"></a>

The fabric uses Go 1.6 vendoring for package management. This means that all required packages reside in the /vendor folder within the obc-peer project. Go will use packages in this folder instead of the GOPATH when `go install` or `go build` is run. To manage the packages in the /vendor folder, we use [Govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor). This is installed in the Vagrant environment. The following commands can be used for package management.

```
# Add external packages.
govendor add +external

# Add a specific package.
govendor add github.com/kardianos/osext

# Update vendor packages.
govendor update +vendor

# Revert back to normal GOPATH packages.
govendor remove +vendor

# List package.
govendor list
```
